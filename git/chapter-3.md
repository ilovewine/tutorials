## About remote repositories

A remote repository is just a git repository stored in the cloud that can be accessed anywhere (assuming you have internet connection and appropriate credentials).

The remote repos are useful when working with multiple collaborators, multiple devices or just for sharing purposes. It is often a good practice to store your code remotely in case it gets corrupted locally. Without the existence of this concept you wouldn't able to read this guide - how else would I publish it? :smile:

There are many tools for remote reporistory creating & maintenance. You may have heard of tools like Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab. This guide will focus on [Github](https://github.com/) only (but feel free to check out other resources as well).

## Working with remote repositories

In order to start working with a remote repo you must first create an account on git hosting service. Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and create your account.
